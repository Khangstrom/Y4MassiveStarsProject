# Y4 Massive Stars Project - Khang Nguyen
A repository to store codes, notes and any work related to my Y4 project

In here, you can find individual folders dedicated for different purposes of the research process:
- Papers: Where I read research papers and make notes of them in a separate document
- Project/Codes: Where I code most of the project. Includes full code, experiments and codes of specific functions.

(Note: Most of my workings/experiments are contained in the folder HD50896. Other WR folders are mostly a copy-and-paste of the code from HD50896 with minor modifications)
- Notes: Where I take weekly to-do notes to track my progress
